# Data Science Assignment 1

This repository contains files and workflows for Assignment 1 of the Data Science course. The assignment focuses on retrieving and analyzing Swedish weather data from the SMHI Open Source Database and connecting it to energy production statistics in Sweden.
## Contents

  _KNIME Workflow_: A structured workflow to fetch, preprocess, and visualize weather data.
  _Weather Data_: Daily and monthly statistics such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
  _Energy Data_: Insights into how weather trends impact renewable energy production (e.g., wind and hydroelectric).

## Features

  _Data Integration_: Combines weather data from SMHI with energy production datasets.
  _Visualizations_: Generates clear and interactive plots to explore trends.
  _Insights_: Investigates correlations between weather and energy outputs.

## How to Run

  Open the KNIME workflow file in the KNIME Analytics Platform.
  Run the nodes to fetch data from the SMHI API and preprocess it.
  View the resulting plots and insights in the output nodes.

## Dependencies

  KNIME Analytics Platform.
  Internet connection for accessing the SMHI database.
  Visualization libraries used within KNIME.

## Future Enhancements

  Adding energy consumption data for a holistic energy analysis.
  Exploring seasonal weather patterns and their impact on production.
